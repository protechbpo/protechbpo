        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Link Next"</strong> refers to our company, an authorized dealer providing intermediary services between consumers and third-party service providers, including but not limited to internet, cellular, streaming, and bundled services.</li>
            <li><strong>"User", "you", or "your"</strong> refers to any person or entity accessing our website or using our services.</li>

        <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>Link Next offers execution services on behalf of third-party service providers. We assist in tasks such as new connection setup, billing assistance, account upgrades, and other support-related activities.

        <ul>
            <li>Link Next is not responsible for the quality, uptime, or reliability of the services delivered by third-party service providers.</li>
            <li>All service-related issues, outages, or quality concerns should be addressed directly with the relevant service provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Account Responsibilities</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Payments and Fees</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Execution Fees:</strong> Link Next charges execution fees for the administrative services it provides. These fees are separate from the charges billed by third-party service providers. These fees cover the execution and facilitation of tasks such as connection setup, plan changes, and account management. These fees will be disclosed before you confirm a service request.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Billing:</strong> The charges billed by third-party service providers are outside of Link Next’s control, and you are responsible for paying these charges directly to the provider according to their billing terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Service Requests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Execution:</strong> We will make reasonable efforts to ensure the timely execution of your requests. However, we cannot guarantee a specific timeframe for completion as it may depend on third-party providers’ processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellations:</strong> If you wish to cancel a service request, you must notify us immediately. Cancellations may only be possible if the request has not yet been executed. For more details, please refer to our Refund Policy.</li>
        </ul>
